## Repository Name: 3D Modeling with OpenGL Homework

**Description:**

This repository contains my homework assignments for the "3D modeling with OpenGL" course at university. Each assignment is organized into its own folder, with the necessary source code files, images, and resources included. Additionally, there are README.md files providing details about each assignment, including its objectives, instructions for running the code, and any additional notes or reflections.

Through this repository, I aim to showcase my progress and skills in 3D modeling and OpenGL programming. It serves as both a record of my coursework and a portfolio of my work in the course, demonstrating my understanding of fundamental concepts in computer graphics and my ability to apply them in practical assignments.
